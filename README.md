First website - Completed in December 2017

This was the first website I had designed and created during college. Code languages used were HTML5,CSS3,PHP,SQL and Javascript.

The aim of the website is to showcase the small town of Collon and all its surrounding places of interested in a nice and attractive way. Idid this by spliting up the pages into different HTML pages and having links to each and every page.

It also includes a means for the user to complete a short survey and post it to a database. This then allows for the user to see what others have posted by displaying the database contents to a table.
