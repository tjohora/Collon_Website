			<h1>Area</h1>
			<p>Collon is home to many facilities within and around it.</p>

			<h2>Go-Karting Track</h2>
			
			<p>On the outskirts of Collon is a Go-Karting track. It is called Whiteriver Karting, and for a fee you can race around the track against others (or drive around yourself), and have fun. Since it's located outside, this leads into having both issues. If it is or has been raining, the road will be wet and slippy. This means that for those that wish to go fast will have to slow down to avoid an accident. Other than that, I really recommend giving it a try: <a href="http://www.whiteriver.ie/" class = "otherLinks"> Whiteriver Go-Karting website</a></p>

			<h3>Animal sanctuary</h3>
			
			<p>Another great facility that collon has to offer is its animal sanctuary. Here, animals are taken care of until they are adopted into a loving home. For those that wish to volunteer or learn more information can look into there Facebook Page or follow this link to there website: <a href="http://www.collonanimalsanctuary.com/" class = "otherLinks"> Collon Animal Sanctuary </a></p>

			<h2>War Museum</h2>
			
			<p>For those that wish to learn about the two world wars, there is a museum located nearby that will allow you to do just that. It recreates the trenches used in World War 1 and the moterized combat of world war 2. Perfect for family and friends that wish to have fun and gain a perspective of what it was like during the conflicts. To learn more about their facility, check out their site: <a href="http://imwm.ie" class = "otherLinks"> Irish Military War Museum</a></p>
