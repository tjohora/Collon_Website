			<h3>Foster Family</h3>
			<p>The Foster family, who came to Ireland from Cumberland in the seventeenth century, were for several generations the dominant influence in Dunleer, which they represented in the Irish House of Commons. Collon House, the family seat was built about 1740 by Antony Foster, Chief Baron of the Irish Exchequer, and extended in the 1770s by his son John Foster, 1st Baron Oriel, the celebrated "Speaker Foster".</p>

			<h2> Mellifont Abbey</h2>
			<p>The old Mellifont Abbey is an interesting as it was founded in 1142, by St Bernard's monks and 10 other french monks. The site for the old Mellifont abbey was donated by O’Carroll, chieftain of Oriel. However, in 1539, King Henry VIII's suppression of the monasteries discontinued any practice. 
			In 1938, at the invitation of Cardinal McRory, the monks of Mount Melleray Abbey in Co. Waterford founded a new monastery at “Oriel Temple”, Collon, on lands which had been part of the property of Mellifont Abbey four hundred years before.
